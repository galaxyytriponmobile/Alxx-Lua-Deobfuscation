 PYTHON TO LUA CODING

Luaminfier.py basically makes your script a bit more readable.✔️

All of these scripts were made by AI, semi-working as of right now,
I will try and add a decompiler into it and with the help of AI.


UPDATE 1: I have done some updates, currently it is pretty good, renames functions variables etc. to numbers to make it more readable, and i am working on getting rid of any semicolons and starting the code at a new line.
