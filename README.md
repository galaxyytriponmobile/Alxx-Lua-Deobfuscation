PYTHON TO LUA CODING

Luaminfier.py basically makes your script a bit more readable.‚úîÔ∏è

All of these scripts were made by AI, semi-working as of right now,
I will try and add a decompiler into it and with the help of AI.


 UPDATE 1: I have done some updates, currently it is pretty good, renames functions variables etc. to numbers to make it more readable, and i am 
 working on getting rid of any semicolons and starting the code at a new line.

 UPDATE 2: Removing semicolons update done.

 UPDATE 3: Also added if the script encounters a ) } ] it starts in a new line.

 UPDATE 4: Re-added semi-colons to help readability.

üî•UPDATE 5: DECOMPILER UPDATE; MAKESHIFT DECOMPILER ADDED! CHECK CODEüî•

 UPDATE 6: New update for putting a space infront of the word "local".

 UPDATE 7: New features added to makeshift decompiler.
