# üêç Python to Lua Converter

**Luaminifier.py** and **Luaminf.manual.py**: Powerful Python utilities for deobfuscating and beautifying Lua scripts. These scripts allow you to make your Lua code more readable through automatic and manual renaming of variables and functions, as well as advanced decompilation techniques.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTICE: READ BEFORE STARTING THE SCRIPT! ‚ö†Ô∏è
------------------------------------------------------------
üö® **DO NOT EXECUTE THE CODE WITHOUT FOLLOWING THESE INSTRUCTIONS!** üö®  
Make sure to **TWEAK THE CODE** at **Line 173** and **Line 176** in `luaminifier.py` before running the script.  
------------------------------------------------------------  

**Potential Issues**  
If the script **closes unexpectedly**, you may have misconfigured it during the tweaks.  
Please **double-check** your adjustments before trying again.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Scripts Overview**

### 1. **Luaminifier.py**
A Python-based tool designed to enhance the readability of obfuscated Lua scripts. It performs deobfuscation by renaming variables and functions, improving the formatting by adjusting indentation and semicolons, and adding several additional Lua code optimizations such as:

- **Variable & Function Deobfuscation**: Automatically renames variables and functions to improve readability.
- **Beautification**: Adjusts indentation and formats code for cleaner presentation.
- **Makeshift Decompiler**: Attempts to reverse certain types of Lua obfuscation patterns, simplifying the code further.
- **Handling Encoded Strings**: Decodes base64-encoded and hex-encoded strings in the Lua code.
- **Optimized for Performance**: Regex optimizations and error handling for better script performance.

### 2. **Luaminf.manual.py** (NEW)
A complementary script to **Luaminifier.py**. This tool offers **manual and automated renaming** of variables and functions after the initial deobfuscation process, giving users full control over making Lua scripts readable and maintainable.


### 3. **testfile.py** (NEWEST)
A fully new test file, just for now. 
- **Requirements**: openai api key (paid).
- `pip install openai` to actually use.
- uses chatgpt after de-obfuscation, to help rename functions and variables, and change the spacing errors (obviously could be done manually).

  
#### Key Features:
- **Interactive Renaming**: Detects all variables and functions in the deobfuscated Lua script and allows the user to manually rename them for better readability.
- **Automated Renaming**: Offers an option to automatically rename variables and functions based on predefined patterns.
- **Advanced Decompilation Techniques**: Simplifies complex Lua patterns, such as obfuscated table indexing and function signatures, making the code more readable.
- **File Handling**: Automatically saves the updated Lua script to a new file with all renaming applied.
- **Improved Edge Case Handling**: Gracefully handles missing or malformed Lua code files and provides meaningful error feedback.

## üöÄ **How to Use**:

### Step 1: Run **Luaminifier.py** to Deobfuscate Lua Code
1. Open a terminal or command line in the directory containing the `luaminifier.py` script.
2. Ensure you've updated **Line 173** and **Line 176** with your file paths.
3. Run the script to deobfuscate your Lua code:
    ```bash
    python luaminifier.py
    ```

### Step 2: Run **Luaminf.manual.py** for Manual/Automated Renaming
1. Once your Lua code is deobfuscated, run `luaminf.manual.py` to manually or automatically rename variables and functions for better readability.
2. The script will prompt you to either manually rename or automate the renaming based on a pattern:
    ```bash
    python luaminf.manual.py
    ```
3. The manually or automatically renamed Lua script will be saved as a new file (e.g., `my_lua_script_renamed.lua`).

## üõ†Ô∏è **Planned Features**:
- **Further Advanced Decompilation**: More techniques to handle highly complex obfuscated Lua code structures.
- **Pattern-based Renaming Enhancements**: Improve the automation of renaming by using smarter patterns that analyze the Lua code for context-aware naming.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Enhancing robustness against malformed scripts, particularly for unconventional obfuscation methods.
- **Increased Logging and Debugging Support**: Providing more detailed logs for better debugging of Lua scripts during the deobfuscation process.
